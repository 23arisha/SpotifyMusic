I built a music recommender system for Spotify that suggests songs based on your listening history and preferences. By analyzing patterns in your musical tastes and incorporating various recommendation algorithms, the system provides personalized song suggestions that match your preference. Itâ€™s a great project for diving into recommendation systems and understanding how they can enhance user experiences by tailoring content to individual preferences.
